# Smart-Token-Distribution-System-STDS-
STDS is a QR-based web application designed to manage food distribution during symposium events. Built using Flask and PostgreSQL, it generates unique tokens for participants and verifies them in real time to prevent duplication. The system ensures secure, fast, and transparent food access with minimal manual intervention.
