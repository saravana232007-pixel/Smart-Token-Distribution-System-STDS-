# Smart Token Distribution System (STDS)
STDS (Smart Token Distribution System) is a web-based QR-enabled Food Token Management System developed to enhance efficiency and security during large-scale symposium and institutional events. Traditional paper-based token systems are prone to duplication, manual verification errors, and crowd congestion. STDS provides a secure digital alternative that automates token generation, verification, and usage tracking.  The system is developed using Python (Flask framework) for backend operations, HTML and CSS for the frontend interface, and PostgreSQL as the database management system. Each registered participant is assigned a unique 6-digit token that is automatically converted into a QR code. During food distribution, the QR code is scanned and validated in real time. Once verified, the system marks the token as used in the database, preventing reuse and ensuring fair distribution.  An administrative dashboard allows secure login, real-time monitoring of token status, and bulk student data upload through CSV files. The system incorporates validation mechanisms to prevent duplicate entries and unauthorized access.  STDS reduces manual intervention, minimizes waiting time, and ensures transparent food distribution in event environments. The project demonstrates the effective integration of digital authentication and database management technologies in modern event management systems.
